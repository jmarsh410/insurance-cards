# Insurance Cards

An SPA built with React showing a list of expandable insurance cards

### Getting Started

Clone the repository and install necessary dependencies with `npm install`.
After dependencies are installed, navigate into the directory and run `npm run
start` to compile the build folder and launch the app in a web browser.

The project is built on top of the
[React Starter Kit](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/) project
using their Yeoman generator `react-fullstack`. However, after updating to the
most recent version of the project, the files are drastically different than the
original generator. If you're looking to see the differences, then I'd start
with the repo and not the generator.

## Tests

Tests can be run with `npm run test`. The majority are for the InsuranceCard
component with a few in the InsuranceListContainer as well
