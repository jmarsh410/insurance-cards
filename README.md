### Getting Started

Clone the repository and install necessary dependencies with `npm install`.
After dependencies are installed, navigate into the directory and run `node
build/server.js` to launch the project on localhost:3001. If you'd like to
recompile everything in development mode, you can also run `npm run start` to
re-compile the build folder and launch the app in a web browser.
